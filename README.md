# Dropheus 

This is the monorepo for the Dropheus chrome extension. Dropheus is a chrome extension that allows you to open a page on Etsy, Amazon, or Ebay, and then it will automatically search AliExpress for matching products, to help you find out if a product is dropshipped, or find better deals.

More information about the extention can be found in the /ext folder's README.md file. More information about the backend server can be found in the /server folder's README.md file.

Backend made by [@Charmunks](https://github.com/Charmunks/), frontend made by [@whatbeato](https://github.com/whatbeato/)
